# Using Express with the Sequelize ORM

_Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Tech Degree - Project 8_

Eighth project in the full stack javascript tech. degree path. Not the most exciting project, but provides a solid introduction to building applications with Node.js, Express, and leveraging the Sequelize ORM. Not the most exciting project, but enough to get familiar with basic CRUD functionality using node.js and express:

- _Express_ - Using express for basic routing and error handling.
- _Sequelize_ - For interaction with an Sqlite database backend.
- _PUG_ - Using the PUG templating framework.

## Getting Started

Project files can easily be cloned and run locally in your browser. Just make sure you have _Node_ installed and run `node install` to install the required packages. You should be able to fire up the app by typing `npm start` into your terminal.
